# ML_fundamentals

## Overview:
This repository contains my personal practice code for Machine Learning.

All files in this repository are written entirely by me from scratch as part of my hands-on learning process. The concepts, exercises, and project ideas are from the [Machine Learning course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmvvaobm7eQ&list=PLeo1K3hjS3uvCeTYTeyfe0-rN5r8zn9rw) by Codebasics on YouTube.

The purpose of this repository is to strengthen my understanding of ML fundamentals by implementing everything independently rather than just following along.

## Topics Covered:
1. Linear Regression (Single varibale, Multivariate)
2. Splitting train, test data
3. Saving a model (pickle, joblib)
4. Dummy variables (pandas) and One hot encoding (sklearn)
5. Logistic Regression (Binary, Multiclass)
6. Decision Tree,
7. Random Forest
8. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
9. Naive Bayes
10. KNN Classification
11. K- means clustering
12. Cross Validation, Hyper Paramter Tuning, Regularization Techniques, Bias and Variance
13. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
14. Feature Engineering (Outlier removal using Percentile, Z score, IQR)


## Tech Stack:
Language: Python
Libraries:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Learning Method:
Instead of simply watching tutorials, I:
    - Re-implement algorithms on my own
    - Break down mathematical concepts into code
    - Experiment with datasets
    - Debug and optimize models
    - Compare results with theoretical expectations
This ensures deep conceptual clarity and long-term retention.

## Goals of This Repository:
- Build strong ML foundations
- Prepare for AI/ML engineering roles
- Develop problem-solving skills
- Create a solid base before moving to advanced topics like:
        - Deep Learning
        - MLOps
        - Computer Vision
